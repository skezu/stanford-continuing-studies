<!-- Slide 8 -->
# Essential Technical Terms Explained  
- **API (Application Programming Interface):**  
  - A set of rules that allows different software systems to communicate.  
- **Webhook:**  
  - A way for one application to send real-time data to another when an event occurs.  
- **Node:**  
  - A single step in a workflow that performs a specific task.  
- **Workflow:**  
  - The complete automation process, comprised of interconnected nodes.

---

<!-- Slide 9 -->
# How n8n Works: A High-Level Overview  
- **Workflow Concept:**  
  - A workflow is a series of connected “nodes” (steps) that pass data along.  
- **Nodes & Connections:**  
  - Each node performs a specific task (e.g., fetching data, transforming it, or sending notifications).  
  - Connections determine how data flows from one node to the next.  
- **Execution Flow:**  
  - Trigger → Processing → Action → Output  
- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  - Visual editor lets you see and adjust the entire process without writing extensive code.

  - **Processing Nodes:** Transform or manipulate data (API calls, filters, code nodes).  
  - **Action Nodes:** Execute an action (send email, post to Slack, update a database).  
- **Data Flow:**  
  - Data moves seamlessly from node to node, following defined paths and conditions.  
- **Visual Representation:**  
  - Think of it as a flowchart where each step depends on the previous one, ensuring automation from start to finish.

# Real-World Use Case: AI Chatbot with RAG Data Source  
<!-- **Scenario:**  
- A business aims to offer instant, context-rich customer support via an AI chatbot.  

**Challenge:**  
- Customer queries require accurate, up-to-date answers drawn from a vast, unstructured data source.  

**Solution:**  
- Build an AI Chatbot in n8n that leverages a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow:  
  - **Trigger:** User sends a query via the chatbot.  
  - **RAG Module:** Retrieve relevant information from a connected datasource (e.g., vector database of documents).  
  - **AI Processing:** Synthesize and refine the response using integrated AI nodes.  

**Outcome:**  
- Delivers accurate, real-time responses that enhance customer engagement and reduce support costs. -->
